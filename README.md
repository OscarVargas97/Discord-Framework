# DISCORD FRAMEWORK 
Because I didn't find any scalable Discord template, I decided to come up with some alignments to make it easier to separate the code, my intention is that people who need to work a Discord bot can have the minimum necessary to start and contribute to the template by uploading their ideas or those practices that they consider to be good practices.

## Quick start

```console
$ https://github.com/OscarVargas97/Discord-Framework.git
$ cd Discord-Framework
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ mv .envexample .env
$ python manage.py
```
## Future features
 - Docker
 - MySql Integration
